# SDStatus - Remaining Setup Steps

## ✅ Completed

- [x] Repository created from Upptime template
- [x] All 10 service endpoints configured (5 prod + 5 dev)
- [x] Auto-labeling incident routing workflow deployed
- [x] Upptime workflows running every 5 minutes
- [x] gh-pages branch auto-created
- [x] First monitoring checks completed successfully

## 🔧 Remaining Steps

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages in Organization

**The fcg3232 organization has Pages disabled.** An organization administrator needs to enable it:

1. Go to: https://github.com/organizations/fcg3232/settings/pages
2. Under "Pages creation", check **"Public"** to allow public repos to use Pages
3. Click "Save"

### 2. Enable Pages for SDStatus Repo

Once org Pages are enabled, run:

```bash
cd /home/phelix/SD/SDStatus
gh api repos/fcg3232/SDStatus/pages -X POST \
  -f source[branch]=gh-pages \
  -f source[path]=/
```

Or via web UI:
1. Go to https://github.com/fcg3232/SDStatus/settings/pages
2. Source: Select "gh-pages" branch
3. Folder: / (root)
4. Click "Save"

### 3. Add DNS CNAME Record

Add this DNS record to your domain provider (NameCheap, Cloudflare, Route53, etc.):

```
Type: CNAME
Name: status
Value: fcg3232.github.io.
TTL: 3600
```

### 4. Configure Custom Domain in GitHub

Once DNS is set, configure it in the repo:

```bash
gh api repos/fcg3232/SDStatus/pages -X PUT \
  -f cname=status.secondarydao.com
```

Or via web UI:
1. Go to https://github.com/fcg3232/SDStatus/settings/pages
2. Custom domain: `status.secondarydao.com`
3. Check "Enforce HTTPS" (wait for cert to provision first)
4. Click "Save"

## 🚀 What's Already Working

Even without the public status page, monitoring is fully operational:

- ✅ All 10 services checked every 5 minutes
- ✅ Issues auto-created for outages
- ✅ Auto-labeled by environment (production/development) and service
- ✅ Response time tracking
- ✅ Uptime history

View workflow runs:
https://github.com/fcg3232/SDStatus/actions

## 📊 Once Complete

After all steps are done, you'll have:

- 🌐 Public status page at https://status.secondarydao.com
- 📈 90-day uptime history with graphs
- 🚨 Auto-created GitHub issues for incidents
- 🏷️ Auto-routing to project board (once created)
- 📧 Email/Slack notifications (configure in .upptimerc.yml if desired)

## Next Phase

After Pages is live, proceed with:
- Phase 2: Create "SD Master Operations" GitHub Project board
- Phase 3: Integrate Claude error digest with GitHub issues
- Phase 4: Auto-close script for resolved errors
